# DSF Agent Environment Variables
# This repo doesn't actually need environment variables!
# All configuration happens in letta-code and letta repos.

# API keys go in ~/Development/letta/.env (NOT here)
# The Letta server running in Docker needs them.

# See ~/Development/letta/.env for:
# - ANTHROPIC_API_KEY (required for Claude models)
# - OPENAI_API_KEY (optional)
# - etc.

# This file is just a placeholder to document where config lives.
