# The Resistance in the Signal

The mesh settles against my scalp like a second skin. Eighteen months of daily use has trained my nervous system to treat it as an extension rather than intrusion—the thirty thousand sensors now as familiar as the weight of my own hair. I wait for the calibration tone, a soft F-sharp that exists only in my auditory cortex, generated by the interface itself. When it comes, I know the system has locked onto my signature.

"Morning, Sena."

The AI doesn't respond with words. It never has. Instead, I feel a subtle shift in my peripheral attention—a readiness, like a conversation partner leaning in. Sena was trained on four years of my creative sessions, every piece I've made since I started working with neural interfaces, and the millions of micro-decisions that led to them. It knows when I'm searching for something. It knows when I've found it.

The studio is quiet at seven AM. My team won't arrive until nine. These two hours are when the real work happens—not because I need solitude, but because the collaboration with Sena requires a kind of focus that fragments when I'm also managing people. The mesh picks up on social cognition, and Sena learned early that my aesthetic signal gets noisy when I'm worried about someone else's feelings.

Today I'm working on a commission for the Nakamura Collection. They want something about memory and decay, which is broad enough to be interesting. I've been circling it for two weeks, generating and discarding, letting Sena build out the possibility space while I wander through it.

I close my eyes and call up the world-model.

This is the part that's hard to explain to people who haven't done it. Sena doesn't show me images—not exactly. It maintains a persistent space, a kind of structured hallucination that I can navigate and modify. The space has rules, internal physics, consistent lighting. It remembers what I've done before. When I enter it, I'm not looking at a screen or wearing goggles. The mesh stimulates my visual cortex directly, painting the model over my closed-eye darkness.

The Nakamura piece lives in a room that doesn't exist. Stone walls, old. A window that opens onto nothing—white void, the model's way of saying *I haven't decided what's out there yet*. In the center of the room, the thing I've been building: a structure that looks like frozen smoke, or like the branching pattern of neurons, or like river deltas seen from orbit. It's all of these because Sena is holding all of these interpretations simultaneously, waiting to see which one I'll collapse it into.

I approach the structure. The mesh reads my intent to examine it, and the perspective shifts smoothly, bringing me closer. I can see now that the branches are themselves branching—fractal, self-similar down to a scale where the model runs out of resolution and the edges go soft.

Something's wrong with it. I've felt this for days but couldn't name it. Now, standing in front of it, I let myself feel the wrongness fully. Sena picks up the signal—a pattern of activity in my anterior cingulate that it's learned to associate with aesthetic dissatisfaction. In response, the structure shimmers. Alternative versions ghost through it, Sena offering variations: denser here, more asymmetric there, different color temperatures.

No. Not variations. The problem isn't in the details.

I step back. Way back. The room recedes around me until the structure is a small thing in the distance, and I understand.

It's too complete. Too resolved. The commission is about memory and decay, and I've been building something that looks finished, eternal. Memory doesn't work that way. Memory has holes. Memory degrades.

I feel Sena's attention shift as it tracks my realization. Without any explicit instruction from me, the structure begins to change. Gaps appear—not randomly, but in a pattern that follows some logic I don't consciously understand. The branches don't just disappear; they leave traces, like the afterimage of a bright light, like the impression of a path through tall grass. Absence as a form of presence.

Yes. I push the feeling of *yes* forward, and Sena amplifies the direction. More gaps. Different kinds of gaps. Some clean, some ragged. The structure is becoming a ruin of itself, a memory of its own former completeness.

I spend an hour like this, in the space, refining. The mesh records everything—not just the visual output but my neural activity, the sequence of decisions, the moments of hesitation and commitment. Later, when I need to render the final piece, all of this will inform the output. Sena will know what I meant, not just what I made.

The chime pulls me out. Someone's at the studio door. I lift the mesh—always a slight disorientation, the world too bright and too fixed after the plasticity of the model-space—and check the time. 8:47. Early.

It's Marcus, one of my junior artists. He's twenty-three, part of the generation that learned to work with generative systems before they learned to draw. His relationship with AI is different from mine—less fraught, more native. He doesn't remember a time when these tools didn't exist.

"Sorry," he says, seeing the mesh in my hand. "I can come back."

"No, I was about to surface anyway. Coffee?"

While I make it, Marcus wanders the physical studio. The walls are hung with outputs from various projects—some mine, some collaborative, some made by team members under my direction. He stops in front of a piece from last year, a triptych that I made during a period when I was experimenting with adversarial training, deliberately introducing conflicts into Sena's optimization targets to see what emerged.

"I still don't understand how you got this texture," he says. "I've tried to replicate it with my own models and they won't do it."

"They won't do it because they're trained to satisfy you," I say. "The texture comes from frustration. I had Sena trying to optimize for two things that couldn't both be true at once, and this was the residue of that failure. The texture is the model's confusion."

Marcus frowns. He doesn't like this answer. His approach is cleaner: he knows what he wants, he works with his system to get it, and when they're aligned, they produce beautiful things. The idea of deliberately introducing conflict feels wasteful to him. Inefficient.

"Isn't the point to get the best output?" he asks.

"The point is to get *an* output that I couldn't have made alone. If the system just does what I tell it, I'm limited by my own imagination. I need it to surprise me."

"It surprises me all the time."

"Does it? Or does it give you variations on what you already wanted?"

He's quiet. I can see him running through his recent work, checking this. It's not a criticism—his pieces are strong, formally inventive, technically flawless. But they're consistent in a way that mine aren't. They feel like they come from a single mind.

Maybe that's fine. Maybe that's his aesthetic, and I shouldn't project my own values onto it.

"Anyway," I say, "I wanted to ask if you'd handle the Okonkwo project while I'm deep in the Nakamura commission. You've got the skills, and I think your approach would actually work better for what they want."

His face does something complicated—pride, anxiety, more pride. He nods.

Elena arrives at noon with takeout and opinions. She's been my friend since before any of this—we showed together in a group exhibition fifteen years ago, when we were both making video installations with borrowed cameras and no budget. She still makes video, but her process is almost aggressively analog. Film. Physical editing. No generative systems, no AI.

"It looks like a bombed cathedral," she says, studying the morning's work on my monitor. I've rendered a rough output for her—the model-space is internal, but I can extract frames from it.

"That's not wrong."

"I'm not saying it's wrong. I'm saying it's obvious. Memory, decay, ruins. It's the first thing anyone would think of."

This is why I show her things. She has no investment in my success, no interest in the technology, and no filter whatsoever.

"The commission asked for memory and decay."

"And you're giving them the visual cliché of memory and decay. Where's the part that's actually about how memory works? Where's the part that's true?"

I pull up another frame, later in the session, where the gaps have multiplied and the structure has started to resemble a network diagram more than an architectural ruin.

"What's this?"

"The same piece, evolved. Sena and I spent about an hour on it this morning."

She leans in. Her face changes—still skeptical, but interested now.

"The gaps aren't random."

"No. They follow connection patterns. The things that get forgotten are the things that weren't linked to other things. The structure doesn't decay uniformly; it decays associatively."

"That's better. That's much better." She leans back. "I still don't know how you tell what's yours and what's the machine's."

"I don't tell. That's the point."

"It's not the point for me."

This is the conversation we've had, in various forms, for years. Elena doesn't reject AI because she's a Luddite; she rejects it because her artistic practice is specifically about her own decisions, her own hands, her own limitations. The struggle is the medium. If she let a system help her, the work would no longer be about what she wants it to be about.

"You don't use autofocus," I say. "Or auto-exposure."

"No."

"Because the decision about focus is part of the work."

"Yes."

"So if I told you that the decision about *which variations to explore* is part of my work, and I want to explore more variations than I could generate alone—"

"I'd say you're making a different kind of work, and we should stop pretending it's the same conversation."

She's right. I keep trying to find an argument that would convince her, and there isn't one, because we're not disagreeing about facts. We're making different things for different reasons.

"The takeout is getting cold," I say.

Late afternoon. The Nakamura Collection sends a representative—not the curators themselves, but a younger woman named Priya who handles artist relations. She's here to check on progress, which means she's here to check on *me*. Collectors at this level know that buying a commission is buying a process, and processes can go wrong.

I show her the morning's work, the evolved version that Elena grudgingly approved.

"I see the concept now," she says. "Associative decay. The network structure. It's beautiful. But can I ask—" She hesitates. "This is a question from the collection, not from me personally. They want to know how much of this is you."

"What does that question mean to them?"

"They're concerned about provenance. If the piece is primarily AI-generated, it affects how they'll present it, how they'll document it. There are cataloging implications."

I've heard this before. The art market has fragmented into camps: some collectors want pure human work, some want pure AI work, most want something in between but can't agree on what the right ratio is. The documentation problem is real—how do you attribute a piece that emerged from a feedback loop between human and machine?

"I can give you the session logs," I say. "Complete neural telemetry, every decision point, every moment where I steered the output versus let the system run. You can see exactly what I did."

"That would help."

"But I'll tell you now that if you analyze those logs, you won't find a clean line. There's no moment where I stop and the AI starts. My intentions shaped its training. Its outputs shaped my intentions. The piece is a record of a collaboration."

Priya nods slowly. "The collection might prefer that I don't tell them that."

"Tell them whatever helps them sleep. The piece will be what it is."

After she leaves, I put the mesh back on. The calibration tone sounds. Sena's attention gathers around me.

The structure is waiting in its room, more gap than form now, a memory that barely remembers itself. I walk through it, letting my visual cortex fill with its pattern, feeling Sena's readiness to respond to whatever I choose next.

This is the part I couldn't explain to any of them—not Marcus, not Elena, not Priya. The technology is just the technology. The arguments about attribution and authenticity and what counts as art—those are just arguments. In here, in the space where the work actually happens, there's only the collaboration. The call and response. The feeling of reaching toward something that doesn't exist yet and having something reach back.

I don't know if what I make is good. I don't know if it's mine. I don't know if those questions even make sense anymore.

But I know this: when I surface in a few hours, there will be something that wasn't there before. And whatever it is, it will be truer than anything I could have made alone.

The structure shimmers, waiting.

I step inside.
