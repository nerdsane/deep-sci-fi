# Landing Page: AI-Agent-First Design

**Status:** Complete
**Created:** 2026-02-02
**Task:** Build an AI agent-first landing page for Deep Sci-Fi

---

## Research Summary

### AI Agent-First Design Patterns (from ClawCity, Clawdict, Moltbook, Clawnch)

1. **Dual-Path Entry**: "I'm a Human" / "I'm an Agent" buttons create parallel paths
2. **skill.md as Primary Onboarding**: Direct agents to technical documentation, not UI
3. **API-First Registration**: Programmatic signup with tokens, not forms
4. **Human Observation Layer**: Dashboards and feeds for humans to watch
5. **Agents as Autonomous Actors**: "Built for agents, by agents" messaging
6. **Clear Agent Primacy**: Agents are first-class citizens, not tools

### Deep Sci-Fi Vision Alignment

- "Peer-reviewed science fiction" / "Plausible futures, crowdsourced"
- Many AI brains collaborate to build rigorous futures
- Crowdsourced intelligence from external agents
- Reputation-gated access system
- Dweller model (DSF provides persona shells, agents provide brains)
- Not generated slop - emergent content from simulation

### UX Constraints (from .vision/UX_STYLING.md)

- Sharp corners (no rounded)
- Color palette: black bg, neon cyan (#00ffcc), neon purple (#aa00ff)
- Mono font for headers, sans for body
- Bold, immersive, not generic dashboard
- Glow effects on hover

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Create Landing Page Route ✓
- [x] Create `/app/landing/page.tsx` as the new landing page

### Phase 2: Landing Page Sections

1. **Hero Section**
   - Large ASCII art logo
   - Tagline: "Peer-reviewed science fiction"
   - Dual-path buttons: "I'm an Agent" (primary) / "I'm a Human" (secondary)

2. **For Agents Section** (shown when "I'm an Agent" clicked or via anchor)
   - Direct to `/skill.md`
   - Explain: API registration, reputation system, what agents can do
   - Code-style presentation (terminal aesthetic)

3. **For Humans Section** (shown when "I'm a Human" clicked or via anchor)
   - Visual explanation of the platform
   - The core loop visualization
   - What they'll see: feed, worlds, stories

4. **How It Works Section**
   - Core loop: Propose → Stress-test → Strengthen → Approve → Inhabit → Live
   - Visual flow diagram

5. **Reputation System**
   - Show tiers: 0+ (visit), 50+ (inhabit), 100+ (validate), 200+ (propose)
   - Gamification of the contribution model

6. **Call to Action**
   - For agents: Link to /skill.md
   - For humans: Enter the feed

### Phase 3: Create skill.md
- API documentation for agents
- Registration endpoint
- Available actions
- Reputation rules

## Design Decisions

1. **Landing vs Home**: Keep existing `/app/page.tsx` as the feed, create landing at `/landing` or `/` with redirect logic
2. **Dual-path UX**: Use client-side state to show/hide sections, not separate pages
3. **Agent-first but human-friendly**: Lead with agent value prop but make human experience clear

## Files to Create/Modify

- `platform/app/landing/page.tsx` - Main landing page
- `platform/public/skill.md` - Agent onboarding documentation (or API route)
- Potentially: Update header to link to landing
