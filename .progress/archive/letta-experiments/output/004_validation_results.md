## 3. "Emotional Physics" Formalization

### Approach

Map emotional dimensions (from affective computing) to physical simulation parameters. The neural interface reads emotional state and modulates world parameters in real-time.

### Parameter Mappings

| Emotion | Physical Parameter | Range | Story Reference |
|---------|-------------------|-------|-----------------|
| Grief | atmospheric_opacity | 0.0-1.0 | "Grief manifests as fog" |
| Joy | bioluminescence_intensity | 0.0-5.0 | "Joy as bioluminescence" |
| Longing | tidal_amplitude | 0.5-3.0 | "Tides respond to longing" |
| Fear | creature_aggregation | 0.0-1.0 | (implicit) |

### Training Process

1. Artist wears neural crown during calibration sessions
2. Experiences target emotions (e.g., remembering father's death for grief)
3. System learns mapping from neural patterns to desired physical effects
4. Real-time inference during creative sessions

### Key Insight

This is **not magic**. It's:
1. Affective state detection (established technology)
2. Learned parameter mapping (standard ML)
3. Physics simulation (well-understood)
