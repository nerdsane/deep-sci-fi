# The Shape of Intention

I put on the band and the studio goes quiet.

Not silent—there's still the hum of the climate system, Javier's music bleeding faintly from his corner, the specific frequency of afternoon light through the north windows. But my mind goes quiet, which is what matters. The band reads best when I'm not trying.

Today's commission is from a woman named Adaora who lost her mother six months ago. She wants a space to grieve. Not a memorial—she was clear about that. Something she can walk through. Something with exits.

I close my eyes and think about doorways.

Not literal doors. The feeling of them. That threshold sensation, the way a room changes you the moment you cross into it. The system catches the shape of what I mean and begins sketching possibilities in the shared canvas—the persistent simulation space where my team and I work.

Three interpretations materialize. I open my eyes and walk through each one.

The first is too architectural. Clean lines, obvious transitions. It feels like a hospital, and Adaora specifically said she's done with hospitals. I dismiss it with a thought.

The second is organic but chaotic. Grief as jungle, grief as overgrowth. There's truth in it—the way loss takes over everything, vines through every thought—but it's missing the exits Adaora asked for. I hold onto the texture and let go of the structure.

The third is almost right. A series of rooms that don't connect logically but flow emotionally. You're in a kitchen, then you're in a field, then you're in a room that feels like 3 AM. The transitions make sense to the heart if not the eye.

I step into the 3 AM room and sit down. The system has furnished it with objects I didn't consciously choose: a cup of cold tea, a window showing nothing, a chair that's been sat in too long. Did I think these? Did the system extrapolate from my emotional signature? This is the part that used to unsettle me.

"What do you think?" I ask, knowing Javier and Meena are watching through their own bands.

Meena steps into the room from wherever she was in the canvas. Her presence changes the light slightly—warmer, because that's her tendency. "The tea is good," she says. "But the window is too empty. Grief isn't absence. It's presence of the wrong thing."

She's right. I focus on the window and think about what should be there. Not a view. Not darkness. Something specific to Adaora, something she told me in our intake conversation.

Her mother used to sing while cooking. Adaora mentioned this almost offhandedly—the sound of her mother's voice, slightly off-key, coming from the kitchen in the early morning.

I don't think the song. I think the *memory of having heard it*, the residue of that sound, the way it lingers after it stops. The window fills with something I don't have words for. A visual representation of acoustic memory. The system interprets my intention and produces a shimmer that is somehow both sight and echo.

"There," Meena says. "That's the exit."

We break for lunch and Javier brings up the trace again.

He's been circling it for weeks—a new tool that maps the genealogy of creative choices. Where each element came from, how much is training data, how much is novel recombination. Some artists are obsessed with it. Others refuse to look.

"I ran my last piece through," he says, chopsticks paused over his noodles. "Forty-three percent traceable to specific sources. Forty-three percent."

"What was the other fifty-seven?" Meena asks.

"Novel combinations. Or untraceable." He shrugs. "Same thing, according to the tool."

I don't ask what I'm thinking, which is: did the number change how you feel about the piece? Javier is younger than me by almost a decade. He learned to make art in a world that was already saturated. The old questions about purity don't stick to him the way they stick to some of us.

"I'm not running my work through it," Meena says. "I already know the answer. Everything I make comes from everything I've seen. That was true before AI. That was true when I was hand-painting in my parents' garage. The only difference is now I can see the receipts."

Javier nods. "So you're not curious?"

"I'm not interested in a number telling me whether I'm creative." She takes a bite. "I know I'm creative because I show up and make choices. That's it. That's the whole thing."

This is why I hired Meena. Not for her technical skill, though that's considerable. For the clarity she brings to rooms that tend toward muddle.

The afternoon session is for depth work.

I enter the canvas alone. The commission space has been growing since this morning—the system runs continuous inference, elaborating the structure based on the constraints I've set. The 3 AM room now connects to a hallway that I didn't design. I walk down it.

The walls are textured with something like breath. In and out, the surface rises and falls. It should be disturbing but it isn't. It feels like being held.

At the end of the hallway is a garden.

I didn't think a garden. The system extrapolated from my intention—exits, Adaora said, and what is a garden but an exit that stays still? The plants are abstract, more suggestion than botany. Colors that don't map to any spectrum I can name. But the feeling is exactly right: the particular relief of stepping outside after being inside too long.

I sit on a bench that materializes as I think about sitting. The system is good at that now—anticipating the desire, not just the explicit command. It's the thing that makes some artists uncomfortable. The way it starts to feel like collaboration with something that isn't quite there.

For me it feels like collaboration with myself. The system is trained on so much human making, including my own work. When it surprises me, I'm never sure if I'm being surprised by something alien or by some corner of my own aesthetic that I hadn't consciously articulated.

Is there a difference?

I used to think there was. I used to worry about it constantly—what's mine, what's machine, where does the human end. Then I stopped worrying and started paying attention to what actually happened when I made things.

What actually happens is: I intend, the system proposes, I choose. The choosing is where I live. The choosing is what makes the work mine.

The garden shivers slightly, waiting for my input. I think about Adaora, about what she said about her mother's last weeks. How she was the one holding everything together. How she never had time to fall apart until after the memorial.

I think about falling apart.

The garden responds. The abstract plants begin to droop, not dying but relaxing. The colors shift toward something softer. The bench I'm sitting on becomes less a place of observation and more a place of collapse.

This is what the old mediums couldn't do. Canvas and oil couldn't respond to intention. They recorded the result of intention, the trace of it, but they couldn't participate.

Now the medium participates.

Whether that's better or worse depends on what you're trying to make. I don't think it's a replacement for anything. Just a different place to work.

That night I meet Kira for dinner. She's a curator at an institution that refuses to show AI-augmented work—their term for what I do, though I don't love it.

We've been together three years. We've also been having the same conversation for three years, though the shape of it keeps changing.

"How's the grief commission?" she asks.

"Close to done. Maybe two more days."

"Is the client going into it herself?"

"That's the plan. Adaora wants to walk through once a week for the first few months. See how it changes."

Kira nods. She doesn't disapprove exactly. She just occupies a different position in the landscape, one where this kind of work is understood to be something other than art. Therapeutic simulation. Experience design. Valuable, but not what she means when she says *art*.

"I'm not judging," she says, because she can read my face.

"I know."

"I just think there's something irreplaceable about constraint. About struggling with a material that doesn't want to cooperate. The canvas pushing back."

"The system pushes back," I say. "Not the same way. But it proposes things I don't want, and I have to reject them. I have to keep choosing."

"But you don't have to develop skill the way you would with—" She stops, recalibrates. "I don't mean skill. I mean relationship. Years of learning how a brush behaves, how charcoal smears, how light falls on specific pigments. The system gives you everything immediately. There's no time to form a bond with your tools."

This is true. The system learns me faster than I can learn it. Sometimes I wonder if that speed is part of what makes the work feel different—not worse, but different. A different kind of intimacy.

"I think about it like this," I say. "Every generation of artists uses the tools that exist. The tools shape what's possible. Fresco painters didn't worry about whether oil was cheating. Photographers didn't worry about whether the camera saw too quickly. The work adapts."

"And something is always lost," she says. "That's my only point. Something specific to the older constraints."

"Something is always gained too."

"Maybe." She smiles at me, the version of her smile that means she's agreeing to disagree. "I like who you are when you argue for it. You get very certain."

"That's the certainty of practice. Ten years of doing this. Watching it work."

"I know. I'm not trying to shake your confidence." She reaches across the table, takes my hand. "I just think about what *I'd* lose. If I gave up the struggle with materials. The specific frustration."

"You'd find new frustrations."

"I'm sure." She laughs. "I'm also sure I'd miss the old ones."

This is where we live, Kira and I. Not in agreement, but in the space between our two certainties. I don't need her to validate what I do. She doesn't need me to admit she's right. We just keep talking, keep pressing on the edges, keep being surprised by where the other one stands today versus last month.

That's its own kind of art. The ongoing negotiation of two people who see the world differently but want to keep seeing it together.

The last day of the commission, Adaora comes to the studio.

I put a band on her and walk her into the space. Her first few steps are tentative—most people's are, the first time they enter a persistent world. The physics feel almost right but not quite. Your body knows something is different.

"This is the kitchen," I say, though she can see that.

She stops. Looks around. The kitchen is full of morning light and the residue of sound—her mother's voice, the off-key singing, translated into something visible. A kind of golden static in the air near the stove.

"How did you—" She shakes her head. "I told you about the singing. I didn't think you'd actually..."

"The system interprets emotional intention," I say. "I thought about what you described, and it found a visual form."

"It's exactly right." Her voice is thick. "Not the literal sound. The *feeling* of it. The way it hung in the air."

We walk through the rooms together. The 3 AM room with its cold tea and its window full of echo. The breathing hallway. The garden of collapse.

She sits on the bench for a long time.

"I didn't know I needed to fall apart," she says eventually. "I thought I needed to stand up. But this—" She gestures at the drooping shapes around us. "This is permission."

I sit next to her. The garden holds both of us.

"It'll keep growing," I tell her. "Based on the rules I set. It'll age slowly. Seasons will pass. But the feeling will stay."

"The feeling stays," she repeats.

"That's what I do. I make spaces where feelings can live. So people can visit them."

She nods. Doesn't say anything else. I let her stay as long as she needs.

---

That night, after Adaora has gone and the studio is dark, I sit in the canvas alone.

Not in the commission space—that belongs to her now. In my own workspace, the unfinished experiments and abandoned sketches that accumulate over years. A landscape of half-thoughts.

I think about Kira's question: what's lost in the new tools. I think about Meena's answer: nothing is lost that wasn't always already borrowed. I think about Javier's forty-three percent and the way he shrugged when he said it.

The system waits for my intention.

I think about authenticity.

Not purity—I gave up on purity years ago. Purity assumes there's a self that exists before culture, before influence, before the vast wash of everything I've ever seen and felt. There isn't. There's just this self, this specific configuration of all those borrowed elements, making choices.

Authenticity is showing up and choosing. Over and over. Choosing what to keep and what to reject. Choosing how to respond to what the system proposes. Choosing who to work with, what commissions to take, when to push back against clients who want something that doesn't serve them.

The choices don't come from nowhere. They come from me—which is to say, they come from everything that made me, filtered through the particular way I've learned to filter.

That's not less than what artists have always done. It's exactly what artists have always done.

The system shimmers around me, waiting. I think about what I want to make next. Something just for myself, maybe. Something I'll never show anyone. The kind of work you do to remember why you do the work at all.

I close my eyes and think about beginnings.

The world responds.
