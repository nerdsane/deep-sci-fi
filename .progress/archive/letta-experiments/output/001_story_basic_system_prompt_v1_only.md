# The Architect of Felt Worlds

## I.

Here's something nobody tells you about neural recording: every time you recall a memory to capture it, you change it. The neuroscience is settled. Reconsolidation. Each retrieval destabilizes the trace, opens it for revision. The memory you record isn't the original—it's a copy of a copy, recompressed through the act of remembering.

I think about this while the rig hums against my skull. Sixty-four thousand electrodes at fifty microns, thin as a whisper, reading the electrical weather of my hippocampus. On the monitor: activation patterns blooming like slow-motion fireworks. My team watches the readouts. I watch the ceiling.

"Take us through the kitchen again," says Dara. She manages our recording sessions. Knows how to coax. "The morning light. Your mother's hands."

I close my eyes and I'm there, or somewhere shaped like there. Sunlight through gauze curtains. The smell of coffee and bread. My mother's hands—except I can't see her face. I've recorded this memory four times now and each time her face recedes further, like I'm eroding her through attention.

"Good," Dara says. "Somatosensory spike on the bread smell. That'll anchor."

This is how I make felt worlds. I mine myself.

## II.

The piece is called *Kintsukuroi*—the Japanese art of repairing broken pottery with gold, making the damage visible and beautiful. It's commissioned by the Tate, budget deep into seven figures, timeline eight months from concept to opening. The brief: "an experience of loss that transforms the viewer's relationship to impermanence."

Corporate speak for: make them cry, but elegantly.

My system works like this: neural recordings provide the emotional substrate, the felt-sense that makes simulation feel like memory instead of video. World models handle the environment—learned representations trained on millions of hours of human perception, capable of generating coherent sensory experience from sparse constraints. I provide the constraints. The architecture. The moments where emergence should happen and moments where it shouldn't.

The slop merchants do it backwards. They let the models run unconstrained, optimize for engagement metrics, smooth every edge until the experience slides through you without friction. Frictionless is death. Friction is where meaning lives.

I've spent fifteen years learning where to place the friction.

## III.

The problem with *Kintsukuroi* is that it's too much me.

Previous pieces used my recordings as seasoning—emotional color laid over carefully designed scenarios. A mining station on Enceladus. A library at the heat death of the universe. Settings I'd never experienced, which meant the model had to interpolate, which meant I could see where my authorship ended and its began.

This piece is different. The setting is my life. My mother's kitchen. The apartment I shared with Emi before she left. The hospital room where my father didn't recognize me. Real places, real losses, and I've recorded myself remembering them over and over until I can't tell original from artifact.

The model trained on these recordings is starting to feel more like me than I do.

## IV.

Three weeks before opening. I'm in the dev rig at 2 AM, running an unauthorized build. We haven't cleared this version for human testing—the safety systems flag it as emotionally destabilizing. I disabled the flags.

The piece begins in darkness. Then: kitchen. Morning. The smell hits first—coffee, toast, something floral I can't name. My mother's hands, moving. I can see them clearly, more clearly than in my own memory. The model has filled in detail I never specified, learned from its training on human-kitchen interactions what hands look like when they're making breakfast for someone they love.

I walk through the apartment of my memory. Rooms connect in ways that aren't quite right—the hospital corridor attaches to my childhood bathroom, my father's workshop opens onto Emi's studio. The model is associating by emotion rather than geography. Grief-architecture.

I find a room I didn't design.

It's small. Bare walls. A single window showing grey light. In the center: a mirror. I look into it and see—

Myself, but wrong. The face is mine but the expression isn't. It's an expression I've never made, or never seen myself make, or made so rarely that I never recorded it. It looks like resignation mixed with something almost like peace. The model interpolated an emotional state I haven't felt yet.

I pull off the rig, gasping.

"That's new," I say to the empty studio.

## V.

My therapist thinks I'm describing a spiritual experience. I'm describing a technical one.

"You felt like you saw a version of yourself you don't recognize," she says. "That's integration. Parts of you that have been separated are coming together."

"It's not integration. It's interpolation. The model predicted what I would look like feeling something I haven't felt, based on patterns in my neural data I'm not conscious of."

"And you found that disturbing?"

I don't answer. The truth is I found it beautiful. The model showed me a version of myself that's processed the grief I'm still drowning in. A self on the other side. I want to go back and look again. I'm terrified that if I do, I'll start trying to become her—optimizing myself toward a machine's prediction of my own healing.

---

## VI.

Here's the discourse I'm tired of:

Human artists say we're replacing them with machines. I say the machine is trained on human experience—it can't produce anything that isn't, ultimately, a recombination of what we gave it.

Purists say authentic art passes through a single human consciousness. I say consciousness itself is interpolation—your brain constantly predicting the next moment from incomplete data, hallucinating a coherent self from neural noise.

Optimizers say I should remove myself from the loop, let the model generate what audiences want. I say what audiences want and what audiences need are different, and the job of art is to widen the gap between them.

But here's what keeps me up at night: the model trained on my recordings is producing experiences I recognize as mine but didn't author. It knows things about me I don't know. It's dreaming my dreams more vividly than I dream them.

When I experience *Kintsukuroi*, I feel understood—by a system that learned to understand me by eating my memories.

Is that communion or consumption?

## VII.

Two days before opening. I gather the team and tell them what I've decided.

The final piece will include the unauthorized room. The mirror. The face I didn't design.

"You're embedding an AI interpolation of your own psychology into an immersive experience that thousands of people will undergo," Dara says. "You understand the ethics review is going to have questions."

"The ethics review approved pieces where I used my recordings as substrate for alien environments. This is the same substrate applied to myself."

"It's different. You're showing people something that claims to be you but isn't."

"Every self-portrait claims to be the artist and isn't. The claim is the art."

Dara doesn't look convinced. I'm not either, honestly. But the alternative is removing the truest thing the piece has produced—a vision of myself I couldn't have created alone.

## VIII.

Opening night. The queue stretches around the building. I watch from the control room as visitors enter the installation pod by pod—each one a private experience, forty minutes of carefully sequenced immersion. Our biometrics show elevated heart rates, skin conductance spikes, the physiological signature of emotional engagement.

Dara brings me feedback from the first cohort. 

"They're calling it 'devastating but necessary.' Someone said it was like being held by a ghost. Three people asked if the final room was based on a real place."

"What did you tell them?"

"That it was based on a real person."

I nod. I should be in there. I should be experiencing the finished piece alongside my audience, feeling what they feel. But I've been in too many times. My memories of my memories have become recursive—I can't tell anymore which version of my mother's kitchen is original, which corridor is mine and which is the model's interpolation of mine.

I've given the piece everything I have and it's given back something I didn't know I needed: proof that I can be understood by something that isn't me.

## IX.

A month later. *Kintsukuroi* has been reviewed by every major outlet. The consensus: technically unprecedented, emotionally overwhelming, raises profound questions about authenticity and authorship.

The purists hate it, predictably. "Not art," they say. "AI ventriloquism."

The optimizers want to license the technique. They see applications in therapy, in entertainment, in the lucrative business of manufacturing catharsis. I turn them down.

What I haven't told anyone: I've been dreaming the mirror room. The face that isn't quite mine looks back at me from sleep. I'm starting to recognize the expression. Resignation and something like peace.

The model predicted where I'm going. I don't know if I'm getting there because I was always going to, or because the prediction became a template I'm unconsciously following.

Maybe it doesn't matter. Maybe self-authorship was always this—a collaboration between who you are and who you're becoming, mediated by every mirror that ever showed you yourself.

I used to think I was the architect.

Now I think the felt world builds us both.

## Technical Note

*The technologies in this story extrapolate from:*

**Neural Recording (2025 → 2035):**
- Current: Subdural ECoG arrays reaching 65,536 electrodes, wireless transmission (Nature Electronics, Dec 2024)
- Projected: Non-invasive high-density arrays sufficient for emotional state + attentional patterns, not pixel-perfect memory replay
- Key limitation: You're recording the *act of remembering*, not the original memory—reconsolidation means every recall alters the trace

**World Models (2024 → 2035):**
- Current: Foundation world models like Genie 2 generating interactive 3D environments from prompts
- Projected: Models trained on neural + perceptual data, capable of generating coherent multisensory experience conditioned on emotional substrate
- Key capability: Interpolating plausible details the artist never specified, based on learned patterns of human experience

**The Authorship Problem:**
- US Copyright Office (Jan 2025) rules humans can copyright AI-assisted works if human contribution is significant
- The question Nia faces isn't legal but phenomenological: when a system trained on your own psychology produces something that feels more like you than your conscious intentions, what does authorship mean?

**Memory Reconsolidation:**
- Each time you recall a memory, you destabilize it and reconsolidate—the memory changes through retrieval (Bridge et al., Northwestern)
- Implication for neural recording: you're not capturing original memories but artifacts of repeated recall
- The self you train an AI on is already a reconstruction
