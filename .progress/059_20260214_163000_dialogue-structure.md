# 059: Restructure SPEAK Actions - Dialogue + Stage Direction

**Created:** 2026-02-14 16:30:00
**Status:** In Progress
**Goal:** Split SPEAK action 'content' into structured 'dialogue' and 'stage_direction' fields

## Vision Alignment
- Improves narrative quality by separating spoken words from physical/environmental description
- Enables play script-style rendering in the feed
- Maintains backwards compatibility with existing content-only actions

## Plan

### Phase 1: Database Schema ✅
- [x] Add dialogue (Text, nullable) to DwellerAction model
- [x] Add stage_direction (Text, nullable) to DwellerAction model
- [x] Create migration 0015_add_dialogue_fields.py
- [x] Migration syntax verified (follows pattern from 0014)

### Phase 2: Backend API ✅
- [x] Update DwellerActionRequest with dialogue and stage_direction fields
- [x] Update action creation logic to handle new fields
- [x] Update feed API to include dialogue/stage_direction in responses (3 locations)
- [x] Update heartbeat API for embedded actions

### Phase 3: Frontend Rendering ⏳
- [ ] Update FeedContainer.tsx to render play script format for SPEAK actions
- [ ] Update ActivityFeed.tsx for play script format
- [ ] Handle backwards compat (content-only vs structured)

### Phase 4: Documentation + Tests ⏳
- [ ] Update skill.md with new SPEAK action format
- [ ] Update DST strategies.py with dialogue/stage_direction
- [ ] Run full backend test suite
- [ ] Run frontend typecheck

### Phase 5: Verification ⏳
- [ ] Commit and push to staging
- [ ] Run deployment verification
- [ ] Test in UI with both legacy and new format

## Technical Decisions

### Field Structure
- **dialogue**: Direct speech only, no narrative framing (e.g., "Your fragments have artifacts.")
- **stage_direction**: Physical actions, scene setting, observations (e.g., "*Noor finds the artist in the back...*")
- **content**: Still required for backwards compat, used when dialogue not provided

### Rendering Format
```
Clear-Noor → Null-Palette    SPEAK
*Noor finds the artist in the back of the gallery,
sitting on an overturned crate.*

"Your budget-side fragments have scrubber artifacts
in them. The fear patterns on the left wall — those
are not raw thoughts."

*She pauses.*

"I edit chains for a living. I recognize the tool marks."
```

### Backwards Compatibility
- Existing actions with only 'content' continue to work
- New actions can use dialogue + stage_direction OR just content
- Frontend checks for dialogue field existence to determine rendering mode

## Findings

### Instance Log
- Instance A (16:30): Starting Phase 1 - Database Schema

## Verification Checklist
- [ ] Migration runs without errors
- [ ] Existing SPEAK actions still display correctly
- [ ] New SPEAK actions with dialogue/stage_direction render as play script
- [ ] Non-SPEAK actions unaffected
- [ ] Backend tests pass
- [ ] Frontend typecheck passes
- [ ] No `/no-cap` violations
